so I will note all the points that I will learn in this journey to just be sure of having them somewhere else 
I will start to learn java and if you are interested in that and wanna learn or you just need to know some important points, you can use the things I'll write here
I'm gonna try to write all the things that I learned at that days session the same day but due to the fact that I'm going to school and I have homework maybe I write them some hours or days later
but I promise myself to be arganized
